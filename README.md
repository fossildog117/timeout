#Timeout

This is a program that retieves all data from TimeOut


The data can be found is a file located in timeout/TimeOut/output.txt where I have attempted to make it as readable as possible and easy to convert into JSON.


The webcrawler works as of November 2016. The main function can be found in DeathToEikon.java and if run will start extracting data from timeout.com
